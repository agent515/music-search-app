# music_search_app

> This app was built as a demonstration on Flutter App Developement as part of a series of lectures I took in a STTP on "Flutter and PWA (Progressive Web Applications): Build Better Web Apps" at TEC.

The name of the app is as misleading as the name of a certain scripting language that is ruling over the web. It does nothing close to music search whatsover... yet!

### Key highlights of the app:

- Auth Provider: Firebase Authentication
- Datastore: Firebase Firestore
- State Management: Riverpod
